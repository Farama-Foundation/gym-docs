Winter is here. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the
park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of
the lake. The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the
ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the
freezing water. At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so
it's absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve
the disc. However, the ice is slippery, so you won't always move in the
direction you intend.
The surface is described using a grid like the following

    SFFF
    FHFH
    FFFH
    HFFG

S : starting point, safe
F : frozen surface, safe
H : hole, fall to your doom
G : goal, where the frisbee is located

The episode ends when you reach the goal or fall in a hole.
You receive a reward of 1 if you reach the goal, and zero otherwise.
