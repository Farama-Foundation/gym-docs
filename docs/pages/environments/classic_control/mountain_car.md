Description:
    The agent (a car) is started at the bottom of a valley. For any given
    state the agent may choose to accelerate to the left, right or cease
    any acceleration.

Source:
    The environment appeared first in Andrew Moore's PhD Thesis (1990).

Observation:
    Type: Box(2)
    Num    Observation               Min            Max
    0      Car Position              -1.2           0.6
    1      Car Velocity              -0.07          0.07

Actions:
    Type: Discrete(3)
    Num    Action
    0      Accelerate to the Left
    1      Don't accelerate
    2      Accelerate to the Right

    Note: This does not affect the amount of velocity affected by the
    gravitational pull acting on the car.

Reward:
     Reward of 0 is awarded if the agent reached the flag (position = 0.5)
     on top of the mountain.
     Reward of -1 is awarded if the position of the agent is less than 0.5.

Starting State:
     The position of the car is assigned a uniform random value in
     [-0.6 , -0.4].
     The starting velocity of the car is always assigned to 0.

Episode Termination:
     The car position is more than 0.5
     Episode length is greater than 200
